class Drone:
    """
    Drone implementation

    Drones in the simulation are served as routers. Each drone can be selected as a potential source node, destination
    and relaying node. Each drone needs to install the corresponding routing module, MAC module, mobility module and
    energy module, etc. At the same time, each drone also has its own queue and can only send one packet at a time, so
    subsequent data packets need queuing for queue resources, which is used to reflect the queue delay in the drone
    network

    Attributes:
        simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
        env: simulation environment created by simpy
        identifier: used to uniquely represent a drone
        coords: the 3-D position of the drone
        start_coords: the initial position of drone
        direction: current direction of the drone
        pitch: current pitch of the drone
        speed: current speed of the drone
        velocity: velocity components in three directions
        direction_mean: mean direction
        pitch_mean: mean pitch
        velocity_mean: mean velocity
        inbox: a "Store" in simpy, used to receive the packets from other drones (calculate SINR)
        buffer: used to describe the queuing delay of sending packet
        transmitting_queue: when the next hop node receives the packet, it should first temporarily store the packet in
                    "transmitting_queue" instead of immediately yield "packet_coming" process. It can prevent the buffer
                    resource of the previous hop node from being occupied all the time
        waiting_list: for reactive routing protocol, if there is no available next hop, it will put the data packet into
                      "waiting_list". Once the routing information bound for a destination is obtained, drone will get
                      the data packets related to this destination, and put them into "transmitting_queue"
        mac_protocol: installed mac protocol (CSMA/CA, ALOHA, etc.)
        mac_process_dict: a dictionary, used to store the mac_process that is launched each time
        mac_process_finish: a dictionary, used to indicate the completion of the process
        mac_process_count: used to distinguish between different "mac_send" processes
        enable_blocking: describe whether the process of waiting for an ACK blocks the delivery of subsequent packets
                         1: stop-and-wait protocol; 0: sliding window (need further implemented)
        routing_protocol: routing protocol installed (GPSR, DSDV, etc.)
        mobility_model: mobility model installed (3-D Gauss-markov, 3-D random waypoint, etc.)
        energy_model: energy consumption model installed
        residual_energy: the residual energy of drone in Joule
        sleep: if the drone is in a "sleep" state, it cannot perform packet sending and receiving operations
        channel_assigner: used to assign sub-channel for transmitting
